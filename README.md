# CWRU-Auto-Enroll
Need to enroll in a class, but it's full? Easy, just keep checking it every day and wait until someone drops the class and a spot opens up! Except.. No one has time for that. Let this automation tool check for you and enroll as soon as a class opens up!

- Here's a fully automated tool developed using Java and Selenium WebDriver that I created

- Watch how it instantly logs into the university student information system and auto enrolls you in a fully enrolled class within 3 seconds of a spot becoming available.

- Experience real-time SMS notifications with 20 possible success/error messages generated using Twilio API.
